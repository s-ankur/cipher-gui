DES CIPHER
Key should be 8 characters
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by NIST.
DES is an implementation of a Feistel Cipher. It uses 16 round Feistel structure.
The block size is 64-bit. Though, key length is 64-bit, DES has an effective key length of 56 bits,
since 8 of the 64 bits of the key are not used by the encryption algorithm
